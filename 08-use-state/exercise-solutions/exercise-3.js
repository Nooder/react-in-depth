/*
    1. Create a new Vite React Project

    2. Create a Profile.jsx file to create a Profile
       Component that you export within it

    3. Inside Profile, create some state that stores a string
       initialized to 'Logged In'. Create an <p> element that
       displays this state text inside it

    4. Create a Button.jsx file to create a Button
       Component that you export within it

    5. Inside Button, create a <button> element with the text
       'Toggle Login' inside. There should be no state in this
       component. Then, add this Button component at the bottom
       of the Profile component (under the p tag)

    6. How would you prop drill the ability for Button to change
       the login text inside Profile? (It should be able to toggle
       the text from 'Logged in' to 'Logged out' and back again)

    7. Import the Profile component in to main.jsx and replace the
       <App /> with it and test that it works in the Browser
