/*
    1. Create a new Vite React project

    2. Create a Button.jsx file that has a component
       that returns a <button /> with some text in it as
       well as an onclick event handler. Make
       the text inside as well as the event handler
       come from props passed in to the component.

    3. Create a Card.jsx file that has a component
       that returns an <h2 /> with some text in it
       as well as a Button element below it. Make
       the text inside the <h1> come from a prop 
       passed in to the component.

    4. Create a Profile.jsx file that returns an
       <h1 /> with a <Card /> component below it.
       Have the text inside the <h1> come from props
       as well as all the props needed for the <Card>.
       (Do not hard code anything for the h1 or the
        Card, have them all come from Profile's props)

    5. Replace the <App /> in the main.jsx file with
       the <Profile /> component above. Create a function
       that logs out the text "It worked!". Pass in all the
       props needed to make all the text show up properly in
       Profile, Card as well as Button as well as the function
       needed for the Button click to work.

    6. Check in your Browser to see if it works as expected
       (Make sure all the text shows for each component and
        text to make sure the button logs when clicked)
