/*
    1. Create a new Vite React Project

    2. Create a file called Parent.jsx and export
       a Parent Component from inside it.

    3. Create a file called Child.jsx and export
       a Child Component from inside it.

    4. Create a new Context inside Parent as well
       as an contextState variable with a String
       value like "I love monkeys!"

    5. Have Parent return the Context's Provider
       Component and import and put a Child component
       as the Provider's sole child. Figure out what
       value(s) to pass in to the Provider as props.

    6. Use the useContext hook inside the Child component
       to return an <h1> with the String value passed down
       from the Parent's context value.

    7. Open your Browser to test that this works. You should
       see your String displayed in an <h1> in the DOM.
